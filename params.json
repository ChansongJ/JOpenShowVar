{"name":"JOpenShowVar","tagline":"Allows reading and writing variables to KUKA robots using a TCP/IP connection","body":"JOpenShowVar\r\n============\r\n\r\nJOpenShowVar is a Java open-source cross-platform communication interface to Kuka robots that allows for \r\nreading and writing variables and data structures of the controlled manipulators. This interface, which is\r\ncompatible with all Kuka robots that use KR C4 and previous versions, runs as a client on a remote computer \r\nconnected with the Kuka controller via TCP/IP. JOpenShowVar opens up to a variety of possible applications \r\nmaking it possible to use different input devices and to develop alternative control methods.\r\n\r\nJOpenShowVar may be used to connect to a real KRC controller or a simulated one using the KUKA.OfficeLite package\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=========\r\nKUKAVARPROXY must firstly be installed on the KUKA  SmartPad (copy paste the folder to somewhere in the windows environment -> run KUKAVARPROXY.exe)\r\nPort 7000 has to set open from the SmartPad:\r\nStart-up -> Network configuration -> NAT -> Add port -> Port number 7000 and Permitted protocols: tcp/udp \r\n\r\nVideo showing a KUKA KR6 R900 sixx being controlled using JOpenShowVar as the communication interface\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aZZAK4oyGg\r\n\r\nExample code\r\n===========\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Example {\r\n\r\n\tprivate static String robotIP = \"192.168.2.2\";\r\n\tprivate static int port = 7000;\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n\t\tCrosscomClient client = new CrossComClient(robotIP, port);  //establish connection\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tCallback readRequest = client.sendRequest(new Request(0, \"$OV_JOG\")); //read request\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(readRequest);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tCallback writeRequest = client.sendRequest(new Request(1, \"$OV_JOG\", \"100\")); //write request\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(writeRequest);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n==============\r\nA big thanks to Massimiliano Fago, which is the original author of KUKAVARPROXY and the C++ project OpenShowVar (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openshowvar/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
